### Description
This current version is the ALPHA release, what you see now is essentially a prototype which we will use to get player feedback. It utilises Python with the customtkinter and tkinter GUI frameworks. Due to limitations of this framework and the current codebase design, we will be abandoning this version and rewriting it in C# armed with the knowledge and feedback gained from this initial release.

Please note that there **WILL** be bugs, we are working on it.

### Disclaimer
Currently the program is flagged by some antivirus solutions as a trojan, this is not the case and it is a false positive (definitely something a hacker would say). This is a well known issue with Pyinstaller and packaged python executables being incorrectly flagged as malware. We submitted this file for analysis to Microsoft and they have deemed it as "Not Malicious" and removed it from their threat database, if this is still flagged as a Trojan for you and you are using Microsoft Defender please let us know in the `Issues` tab.


### Installation:
1. Download the newest version of `2kan.zip` zip file from our [releases](https://github.com/Loki-Lokster/2KAN/releases) page.
2. Extract the zip and run `2KAN.exe`.
3. The application will automatically search common install locations for KSP2. If this does not work you can manually select the location using `Browse`. Ensure that a valid game version has been detected.
4. If this is your first time running the application, a dialog box will appear asking you to install SpaceWarp + BepInEx, select `Yes` as these are the modloaders.
