#### Description
This current version is the ALPHA release, what you see now is essentially a prototype which we will use to get player feedback. It utilises Python with the customtkinter and tkinter GUI frameworks. Due to limitations of this framework and the current codebase design, we will be abandoning this version and rewriting it in C# armed with the knowledge and feedback gained from this initial release.

Please note that there **WILL** be bugs, we are working on it.

#### Installation:
1. Download the `2kan.zip` zip file from our `releases` page.
2. Extract the zip and run `2KAN.exe`.
3. The application will automatically search common install locations for KSP2. If this does not work you can manually select the location using `Browse`. Ensure that a valid game version has been detected.
4. If this is your first time running the application, a dialog box will appear asking you to install SpaceWarp + BepInEx, select `Yes` as these are the modloaders.
